It is quite easy to develop with some simple validations and error checks. Player-1 starts playing the game and both the players make their moves in consecutive turns. The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.   

Prerequisite: Basic knowledge of some front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
